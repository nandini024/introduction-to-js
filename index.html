    <h1>What is Java Script ..?</h1>
    <p>JavaScript (JS) is a programming language used to create interactive and Dynamic  web pages. <br> It's one of the most widely used programming languages in the world. </p>
    <p> JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language. <br>
 
        JavaScript is the programming language of the Web. <br>
        
        JavaScript is easy to learn. <br>
        
        This tutorial will teach you JavaScript from basic to advanced.</p> <br>

   
    
    <h1>APPLICATIONS OF Js</h1>
    <p>1Ô∏è‚É£ Web Development ‚Äì Frontend (React, Angular, Vue) & Backend (Node.js).<br>
        2Ô∏è‚É£ Mobile Apps ‚Äì React Native, Ionic for cross-platform apps. <br>
        3Ô∏è‚É£ Game Development ‚Äì Phaser.js, Three.js for 2D/3D games. <br>
        4Ô∏è‚É£ Server-Side ‚Äì Node.js, Express.js for APIs & real-time apps. <br>

        <H1> Advantages Of Java Script.</H1>
        <p>1Ô∏è‚É£ Fast Execution ‚Äì Runs directly in the browser without compilation. <br>
            2Ô∏è‚É£ Easy to Learn ‚Äì Simple syntax, beginner-friendly.  <br>
            3Ô∏è‚É£ Full-Stack Development ‚Äì Used for both frontend (React, Vue) & backend (Node.js).  <br>
            4Ô∏è‚É£ Highly Interactive ‚Äì Enables animations, dynamic content, and real-time updates.  <br>
            5Ô∏è‚É£ Asynchronous & Non-Blocking ‚Äì Efficient handling of tasks using Event Loop & Promises.  <br> 
            6Ô∏è‚É£ Cross-Platform ‚Äì Works on web, mobile, desktop, and IoT.</p> 
            <br> <br>
            <br>
        <h1>JavaScript Engine..</h1>

    <p>The JavaScript Engine is responsible for reading, compiling, and executing JS code in browsers (V8 in Chrome, SpiderMonkey in Firefox, etc.) or runtime environments (Node.js).

        üëâ It works in 4 major steps: <br>
        1Ô∏è‚É£ Parsing (Breaking the code into meaningful structures) <br>
        2Ô∏è‚É£ Compilation (Converting into machine-friendly code) <br>
        3Ô∏è‚É£ Execution (Running the code using the Call Stack & Memory Heap) <br>
        4Ô∏è‚É£ Optimization (Making it even faster for repeated execution)</p> <br>

        <br>
      <h1>  How the Event Loop Works?</h1>
        The Event Loop constantly checks the Call Stack & Callback Queue and ensures that the JavaScript execution remains non-blocking. <br>
         
        üí° Key Players in the Event Loop: <br>
        1Ô∏è‚É£ Call Stack ‚Üí Executes synchronous code (LIFO - Last In, First Out).  <br>
        2Ô∏è‚É£ Web APIs ‚Üí Handles async tasks like setTimeout, fetch, and DOM events. <br>
        3Ô∏è‚É£ Callback Queue ‚Üí Stores async callbacks that need to be executed. <br>
        4Ô∏è‚É£ Microtask Queue ‚Üí Stores Promises & Mutation Observers (executes before normal callbacks). <br>
